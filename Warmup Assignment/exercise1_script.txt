## Exercise 1: Code Structure Overview (1-minute script)

"The search client is structured around three core layers:

First, the DOMAIN REPRESENTATION:
- State.py defines how we represent the world: agent positions, box locations, walls, and goals. description of the world at a given time
- Action.py defines what agents can do: Can only do Move and NoOp actions. Set of actions applicable in state s. 
- Color.py maps agents and boxes to their colors

Second, the SEARCH FRAMEWORK:
- GraphSearch.py is where we'll implement the actual search algorithm—currently it just returns a hardcoded solution
- Frontier.py manages the search queue—FrontierBFS is already implemented for breadth-first search
- Heuristic.py will hold evaluation functions for informed search like A*

Third, the EXECUTION LAYER:
- SearchClient.py is the main entry point—it parses levels from the server, calls the search, and sends back the solution
- Memory.py monitors resource usage to prevent exceeding the 2GB limit

The flow is: SearchClient (main file) reads a level → creates initial State → calls GraphSearch with a Frontier → GraphSearch returns a plan → SearchClient sends actions to the server.

Currently, the code can't solve levels because GraphSearch just returns a fixed action sequence. Our job is to implement proper graph-search algorithms in GraphSearch and complete the frontier data structures."

Visual suggestion: Draw boxes for each component with arrows showing: 
SearchClient → State/Action/Color → GraphSearch ← Frontier/Heuristic → Memory
